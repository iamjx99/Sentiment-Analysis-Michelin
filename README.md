# Sentiment-Analysis-Michelin




中文簡介請見文末


## 1. Introduction
The rise of social media and online review platforms has profoundly transformed how consumers make dining decisions.  
Websites such as **Yelp**, **Google Maps**, and **TripAdvisor** enable customers to share detailed experiences about food quality, service, and ambience, making peer-generated content a powerful driver of reputation in the restaurant industry.  
These reviews—often perceived as authentic reflections of real experiences—have become essential for potential diners seeking reliable insights, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, when online visibility became critical for business survival.

Meanwhile, the **Michelin Guide**, first published in the early 20th century by the French tire company Michelin, remains the global benchmark for culinary excellence.  
Its star system, awarded by anonymous and professionally trained inspectors, assesses restaurants according to the quality of ingredients, mastery of technique, creativity, consistency, and overall harmony of the dining experience.  
Earning a Michelin star can dramatically increase a restaurant’s prestige, reputation, and profitability.  

However, the **perspective gap** between expert evaluations and public opinion presents an intriguing question:  
do consumers perceive Michelin-rated restaurants in the same way that experts do?  
While Michelin reviews reflect elite culinary standards, crowd-sourced opinions on Yelp capture the experiences and expectations of everyday diners — a more inclusive and democratic measure of satisfaction.

This study therefore investigates the **relationship between expert ratings and consumer sentiment**.  
It focuses on restaurants in **London**, one of the world’s most vibrant culinary capitals, and compares **Michelin-starred**, **Bib Gourmand**, and **non-Michelin** establishments.  
Through quantitative text and sentiment analysis of Yelp reviews, the research examines whether customer satisfaction aligns with Michelin recognition, and explores what linguistic and emotional cues shape perceptions of value and quality.

Ultimately, this work aims to bridge the gap between **computational text analytics** and **hospitality research**, contributing to a deeper understanding of how data-driven sentiment insights can complement traditional expert evaluation systems.
