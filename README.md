## ## Abstract

This study explores the relationship between **expert evaluations** from the Michelin Guide and **public sentiment** expressed in online restaurant reviews.  
While Michelin stars symbolize professional culinary excellence, everyday diners increasingly rely on platforms such as Yelp to share personal experiences and opinions.  
This research investigates whether these two perspectives align, diverge, or reveal deeper insights into how consumers perceive fine dining and value-oriented restaurants.

Using over **40,000 Yelp reviews** from **350 restaurants across London**, the project applies a combination of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **statistical analysis** techniques to evaluate sentiment and thematic patterns.  
Key methods include text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal), **VADER-based sentiment scoring**, and **topic modeling** via Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).  
A series of **ANOVA and regression tests** are performed to examine sentiment differences between Michelin-starred, Bib Gourmand, and non-listed restaurants.

The findings reveal a meaningful **gap between expert judgment and public opinion**.  
Although Michelin-starred venues generally receive positive reviews, **Bib Gourmand restaurants** — which emphasize affordability and quality — often achieve **higher consumer satisfaction scores**.  
Topic modeling further highlights that **service quality**, **ambience**, and **value-for-money** are recurring factors influencing sentiment polarity.  
These insights demonstrate how data-driven sentiment analysis can complement traditional expert evaluation frameworks, offering a more inclusive understanding of consumer experiences in the hospitality industry.

This project showcases practical competence in **data preprocessing**, **machine learning for text**, and **statistical interpretation**, illustrating how academic research can translate into real-world data science applications.

## 1. Introduction
The rise of social media and online review platforms has profoundly transformed how consumers make dining decisions.  
Websites such as **Yelp**, **Google Maps**, and **TripAdvisor** enable customers to share detailed experiences about food quality, service, and ambience, making peer-generated content a powerful driver of reputation in the restaurant industry.  
These reviews—often perceived as authentic reflections of real experiences—have become essential for potential diners seeking reliable insights, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, when online visibility became critical for business survival.

Meanwhile, the **Michelin Guide**, first published in the early 20th century by the French tire company Michelin, remains the global benchmark for culinary excellence.  
Its star system, awarded by anonymous and professionally trained inspectors, assesses restaurants according to the quality of ingredients, mastery of technique, creativity, consistency, and overall harmony of the dining experience.  
Earning a Michelin star can dramatically increase a restaurant’s prestige, reputation, and profitability.  

However, the **perspective gap** between expert evaluations and public opinion presents an intriguing question:  
do consumers perceive Michelin-rated restaurants in the same way that experts do?  
While Michelin reviews reflect elite culinary standards, crowd-sourced opinions on Yelp capture the experiences and expectations of everyday diners — a more inclusive and democratic measure of satisfaction.

This study therefore investigates the **relationship between expert ratings and consumer sentiment**.  
It focuses on restaurants in **London**, one of the world’s most vibrant culinary capitals, and compares **Michelin-starred**, **Bib Gourmand**, and **non-Michelin** establishments.  
Through quantitative text and sentiment analysis of Yelp reviews, the research examines whether customer satisfaction aligns with Michelin recognition, and explores what linguistic and emotional cues shape perceptions of value and quality.

Ultimately, this work aims to bridge the gap between **computational text analytics** and **hospitality research**, contributing to a deeper understanding of how data-driven sentiment insights can complement traditional expert evaluation systems.
